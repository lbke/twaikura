## Install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcan-next-starter.git
yarn
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
You can then access the live docs on [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

### Setup your own git

#### Initialization
```sh
# Rename "origin" to "upstream", so you can use your own git repository as the main origin and VN official repo as "upstream"
git remote rename origin upstream
```

#### Update

You can update your Vulcan Next install. Beware: Vulcan Next is a boilerplate, the possibility to update automatically is not guaranteed. You may
have to apply the updates by hand, comparing Vulcan Next latest version to your own code.

```sh
# Get the latest version of Vulcan Next locally
git fetch upstream
# Merge to your own code (favouring your own code as a default in case of conflict)
git merge upstream/master -X ours
```

### Roll your own Mongo database

As a default, Vulcan Next will connect to a sample read-only database owned by LBKE.
To create your own application, you'll want to use your own databse.

#### 1. Run a Mongo server using Docker

[**See Docker installation instruction for Ubuntu here**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

```sh
# It will run Mongo in your current terminal, or create and run a Mongo image if it's the first time your run the command
yarn run start:mongo
```

#### 2. Configure your application to use your local database

In `.env.development` or `.env.development.local` use this URI for Mongo:

```
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/vulcan-next-app"
```

We advise to use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to visualize your database content.
